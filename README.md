Description:

This project is a basic implementation of a light bulb toggle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly interface featuring a button that, upon clicking, toggles the state of a light bulb between on and off. Leveraging the Document Object Model (DOM), the dynamic manipulation of HTML elements enables seamless implementation.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the project structure, including the button and the light bulb element.
CSS: Applies styling to enhance the visual appeal and user experience. Different styles are used for the button and the light bulb in on and off states.
JavaScript: Implements the core functionality, utilizing event listeners to detect button clicks and dynamically updating the DOM to toggle the light bulb state.
Key Features:

Toggle Button: A single button is provided for users to interact with, seamlessly switching the state of the light bulb.
Dynamic Styling: The appearance of the light bulb changes in real-time, providing visual feedback to users about its current state.
DOM Manipulation: JavaScript interacts with the DOM, enabling the dynamic update of content and style in response to user actions.
